            <p>
                I am an experienced department manager and a hardworking employee who tries to grow, learn and excel
                wherever possible. I am always looking for new skills and opportunities to expand my knowledge and
                abilities. I enjoy working as a member or leader of a team and get along easily with others. I can also
                work alone and stay motivated and productive. In every company I have worked in thus far I have been a
                trusted key holder and the non-official IT person. Excellent customer service and communication skills
                have always been very important to me.
