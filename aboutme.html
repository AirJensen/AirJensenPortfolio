            Hello! A little about myself.... I love to learn. I enjoy everything about the outdoors and
            have spent most of my life exploring the mountains with my dad. I love four wheeling, hiking, fishing and
            rockhouding. I grew up playing soccer, tennis, softball, and basketball. I love to read and try to get
            through at minimum 15 books a year. I served an LDS mission in New York City so even though my heart craves
            the quiet of the mountains and open space I also love and have so much respect for the big city and the
            diversity of
            cultures, religions and people there. I miss it often but I DO NOT miss the roaches. I come from a
            large very tightly knit family within which I dont even hesitate to claim the title of favorite aunt. Fun
            Facts: I own several really cool
            lightsabers. At Hogwarts I would be a Gryffindor and in Roshar I would be a Windrunner. I am hoping to jump
            into the Tech industry in order to be able to provide a better life for myself and continue on the path of
            learning new and interesting things forever.
        </p>
